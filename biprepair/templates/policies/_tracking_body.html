    <h2>🔢 How Tracking Numbers Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each appointment generates a unique tracking number (e.g., BIP-260116-AB1Z). Keep it for walk-ins, pickups, and remote updates.</li>
        <li>The tracking number is required to check repair status, authorize pickup, or request admin support.</li>
        <li>Technicians will never ask for your password, PIN, or OTP—only the tracking number plus a verification step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🪪 Recovery Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you lose the tracking number, recovery is possible only after verifying the registered contact number, the optional email on file, or presenting a valid campus ID for admin-assisted lookup.</li>
        <li>Full tracking numbers are never shown publicly. We display masked versions (e.g., BIP-260116-AB••) during recovery.</li>
        <li>Requests based solely on a name are rejected to protect privacy.</li>
        <li>Multiple failed recovery attempts may result in temporary blocks to prevent abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔐 Security & Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No public listing of appointments exists. Only authenticated admins and the original client can view the full record.</li>
        <li>Contact data is protected under the Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Act (R.A. 10173).</li>
    </ul>
