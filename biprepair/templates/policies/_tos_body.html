    <h2>🔧 Service Scope & Technical Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Repairs are limited to modular or plug-and-play part swaps. We do not perform soldering or board-level work.</li>
        <li>Battery replacements for iPhones are not offered because they require sealed-lab equipment.</li>
        <li>If a request is unsafe, uses counterfeit parts, or risks campus facilities, the technician may decline it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📱 iPhone-Specific Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>iPhone services are minimal and may rely on third-party or refurbished components.</li>
        <li>Parts are delivered as-is; compatibility and long-term durability cannot be guaranteed.</li>
        <li>Face ID, Touch ID, and water-resistance ratings may be lost after non-OEM repairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚠️ Risk, Liability & Loss of Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pre-existing or hidden damage is the client’s responsibility; new symptoms may appear during testing.</li>
        <li>Back up your files. Data loss or corruption remains the client's responsibility.</li>
        <li>The technician is not liable for manufacturer defects, shipping delays, or third-party part failures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧾 Parts & Maintenance Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All parts are externally sourced; pricing depends on current supplier availability.</li>
        <li>Installation does not include ongoing maintenance, calibration, or software fixes.</li>
        <li>Repairs are best-effort swaps: drops, moisture, or tampering after release fall outside the service scope.</li>
        <li>iPhone components cost more and suppliers typically provide limited or no recourse for defects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💰 Payments & Expenses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All payments are handled manually (cash or GCash). There is no online payment gateway.</li>
        <li>The technician may request a partial or full deposit before ordering parts.</li>
        <li>Ordered parts are non-refundable. If the client cancels, the part cost remains payable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🤝 Responsibility & Honesty</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Technicians commit to transparent diagnostics, estimated turnaround times, and honest updates.</li>
        <li>Clients must provide accurate device information (model, prior repairs, account locks). Misrepresentation voids service responsibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔢 Appointment Tracking Number Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every appointment receives a unique tracking number. Keep it for status checks and pickup verification.</li>
        <li>To recover a lost number, the client must verify either the registered contact number, the optional email on file, or undergo admin-assisted verification.</li>
        <li>Full tracking numbers are never displayed publicly. Recovery emails or dashboards show masked IDs (e.g., BIP-250101-AB••).</li>
        <li>Multiple failed recovery attempts may result in temporary blocks for security.</li>
        <li>See the Appointment Tracking Policy for the complete workflow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚖️ Legal References</h2>
    <p>This service follows the intent of R.A. 7394 (Consumer Act of the Philippines) and R.A. 8792 (E-Commerce Act). Disputes are handled amicably within the BiPSU Student-Technician Repair Hub before escalation.</p>
